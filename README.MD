# Tactix

Chess Engine written in Go. The goal of this project is to create a chess engine that can play chess at a decent level.

For now the engine is just a simple implementation of a chess engine with legal move generation. The engine is not UCI compatible yet.
Running the enigne provides a simple command line interface to interact with the engine.

## Usage

To get started, clone the repository and run `go run Tactix/main.go` to start the engine.

The engine is not UCI compatible yet. Type `help` to see the available commands.
