# Tactix

Chess Engine written in Go. The goal of this project is to create a chess engine that can play chess at a decent level.

For now the engine is just a simple implementation of a chess engine with legal move generation. The engine is not UCI compatible yet. Running the enigne provides a simple command line interface to interact with the engine.

## Usage

To get started, clone the repository and run ash `go build` in the root directory of the project. This will create an executable file "tactix.exe" in the root directory. Run the executable file to start the engine.

The engine is not UCI compatible yet. Type `help` to see the available commands.
